<p class="tagline">Open-source replacement parts for appliances</p>

## Why OpenSpare?

Many appliances break down because of simple parts: burnt-out control boards, worn-out buttons, broken plastic pieces that are no longer available.

Manufacturers often charge prohibitive prices or don't provide these parts anymore. **OpenSpare offers an alternative**: a free library of open-source designs that anyone can reuse, modify, and manufacture.

Like generic drugs that provide the same treatment at a lower cost, OpenSpare parts deliver the **same function** as original manufacturer parts — but openly and affordably.

## What's Available?

### Printed Circuits

We provide source files of printed circuits designed with KiCad:
- **KiCad source files** (project, schematics, board) — freely reusable
- **Fabrication outputs** (Gerber files, BOM) — ready for manufacturing

### 3D Models

Coming soon...
