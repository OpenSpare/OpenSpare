**OpenSpare** is an open-source initiative to design and share replacement parts for appliances, with the goal of extending their lifespan and reducing our environmental impact.

## Why OpenSpare?

Many appliances break down because of simple parts:
- burnt-out control boards,
- worn-out mechanical buttons,
- broken plastic pieces that are no longer available.

Manufacturers often don't provide these parts, or only at a prohibitive cost.
OpenSpare offers an alternative: a **free library** of designs that anyone can reuse, modify, and manufacture.

We believe that access to open replacement parts is essential to make repair accessible to everyone.
OpenSpare aims to become a **shared resource** that helps to:
- extend the life of appliances,
- reduce electronic waste,
- save money,
- and strengthen the autonomy of users and repairers.

## What's Available?

### Printed Circuits

We provide source files of printed circuits designed with KiCad. Each design includes:
- **KiCad source files** (project, schematics, board) — freely reusable by anyone.
- **Fabrication outputs** (Gerber files, NC drill files, Bill of Materials) — ready for manufacturing.

### 3D Models

Coming soon...

## Repository Structure

- `kicad/` — component libraries (symbols, footprints & 3D models, datasheets)
- `parts/` — designs including source files and fabrication files

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome:
- Adding new parts (PCB, 3D, documentation)
- Improving existing designs
- Manufacturing, testing and sharing feedback
